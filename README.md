Simon Game
This is a simple Simon Game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game tests your memory by challenging you to repeat a sequence of colors that light up in a     specific order. As you successfully replicate the sequence, the game advances through levels with longer sequences.

Features:
Color Sequence: The game generates a random sequence of colors for the player to memorize.
Player Input: The player must click on the buttons in the exact order that the colors were shown.
Increasing Difficulty: The sequence gets longer with each level.
Game Over: If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and the score (level) is displayed.
Flash Effects: The buttons flash when it's the game's turn to show the sequence, and they also flash briefly when the player interacts with them.

Gameplay:
Press any key to start the game.
Observe the color sequence that flashes on the screen.
Click the buttons in the same order to repeat the sequence.
Each correct sequence increases the level and adds a new color to the pattern.
The game ends if you click the wrong color, and your score (current level) will be shown.
Technologies Used:
HTML: To structure the page and define the game interface.
CSS: For styling the buttons and adding transition effects like flashing when colors are shown.
JavaScript: To manage game logic, including sequence generation, user input validation, and level tracking.

Instructions:
To start the game, press any key on your keyboard.
The game will display a sequence of colors.
Click the colored buttons in the same order to repeat the sequence.
